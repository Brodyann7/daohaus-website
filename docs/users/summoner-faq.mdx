  <summary>Q: What is "Dilution Bound" in Hard Mode settings when summoning a DAO?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: Dilution bound is to a mechanism to handle edge cases where many members RageQuit, increasing the dilution of non-ragequit members. 
This hasn't been used before, but 3 is usually good.

  <summary>Q: There is no explicit setting for proposal velocity in Hard Mode. Where is it?</summary>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

A: In Hard Mode, the voting period is equal to the proposal velocity.  So, at a default of 7200 seconds, it is 2 hours. If mutiple proposals are submitted at the same time, one proposal will enter into voting every 2 hours (first in, first out).  Therefore, with a shorter voting period you raise the upper limit for proposal velocity in your DAO.

  <summary>Q: Can I change the proposal velocity / voting period after creating the DAO?</summary>
  
  A: Unfortunately, no. The alternative would be to upgrade your DAO, clone the members / shares and transfer the balances over to the new DAO.
